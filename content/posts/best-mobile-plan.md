## Maybe the best plan(s) for dual sim phones

Requirements:

- Phone with support for Dual Sim Dual Standby (or Active)
- [Google Fi Mobile Plan](https://fi.google.com)
- [T-Mobile Data Prepaid](https://prepaid.t-mobile.com/prepaid-internet)

So, if you haven't already heard about Google's cell phone service, it's a solid plan if you don't use too much data, and the best plan if you travel overseas. The one downside is that "unlimited" data costs 60$, so I decided to figure out the best data-only plan to supplement Fi. This would allow me to use Fi to power text/calling always, and Fi to power international data, but use another provider for unlimited data within the states.

Why Google Fi?

- Cost: 20$ for unlimited text/calling + $10 per gb of data used up to a 6b maximum
- Any unused data is refunded. e.g. if you use 500mb, you'll only be charged 5$
- Pause/Unpause whenever. You'll only be charged for the days you were active per month and charged only that proportion of the $20 monthly fee
- By far the best designed, clearest mobile application
- The best, friendliest customer service of any mobile carrier in the US
- Up to 4 data sims tied to your data plan for no additional cost (Used to be 9)
- Works in 200+ countries at no additional cost
- Free international texting and affordable voice calls, too

Why T-Mobile Data Prepaid?

- 10$/mo provides unlimited data with 2gb of highspeed and things like music stream do not count towards the high speed data usage.

Alternatives:

- [ATT Mobile Prepaid](https://www.att.com/prepaid/)
- [Mint Mobile Prepaid](https://www.mintmobile.com/plans/)
- [T-Mobile Prepaid](https://prepaid.t-mobile.com/prepaid-plans)
- [Verizon Prepaid](https://www.verizonwireless.com/prepaid/)

Alternative Considerations:

- ATT Mobile Prepaid has a special running that gets you a year of unlimited talk/text/data for about 25$ a month, and also provides diversification in cell service as Google Fi does not piggy back their network. If you need two numbers, this would would be the way to go.
- Mint is on the T-Mobile network, so either have cheap options for talk/text/calling, but unless you need two phone numbers there isn't much reason to pay more than 10$ for a data only plan.
- Verizon is probably the best option for network diversification if your phone supports CDMA, and data only plans start at $30.
