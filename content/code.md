##### Silly Projects

##### Not So Silly Projects

##### Gists Disguised NPM Packages
Why? Because I wanted publicly available npm packages that were not listed on the npm registry. Privacy through obscurity I suppose...

- S3Upload.js | a small library I use to upload files to S3 | [gist](https://gist.github.com/gnitnuj/eb216ab0f687c7d9f3691f2efa7715bb)
- AccumulateFiles.js | recursively search a directory and return an array of accumulated files | [gist](https://gist.github.com/gnitnuj/833bcd35413f0f90d692c7d8d5bc22c8)
- ContentType.js | given a file path, return content type | [gist](https://gist.github.com/gnitnuj/9318fbe9eae86a6e1f7e01b7eaa28cc6)
- Promisified Slack Webhooks | a little snippet I use to DRY up the CI/CD process at true[X] | [gist](https://gist.github.com/gnitnuj/1b12b00c7993f37dc6e392623990b9e0)
