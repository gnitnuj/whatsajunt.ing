## Adventures in Lombok Partie Deux

Update! (If you're wondering on what, [this](/posts/rebuilding-lombok))

Looks like the risk paid off. With 12 houses built, the indonesian government finally paid out after making some changes to the phase rules on their end and causing some heaaches on ours.

Now, we can towards bidding on and buying materials for our next project, which will likely be a small school or finishing the abandoned work of prior builders.
