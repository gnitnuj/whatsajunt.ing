## Hello

So, my site has been a full page of animated sheep for the last two years... It was only supposed to be temporary, but hey, two years late is still better than never! Anyways, my intention is to write more, but either way, it feels pretty good to get this static website setup again using Hugo. At the very least, I do intend on keeping this site up to date with the things I have, or am currently working on. So, to start things off here is a link to the [code](https://github.com/gnitnuj/whatsajunting.com "whatsajunting.come github!") for this site!
