        So I bought a BENQ monitor, which I've been competely happy with other
        than the VESA mount not being available for purchase... From reading the
        BENQ forums, it seems as though the manufaturer that they contracted the
        work out to went out of business, and for some reason they've decided
        against finding a replacement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Luckily, some light googling led me to this
        <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3021381">thing</a> on
        thingiverse, where the CAD files were readily available. After
        experimenting with different filament types and fill levels with my
        co-worker at the time, I settled on 50% fill using PLA+, and 6 hours
        later I had a mount which has showed no signs of deterioration over the
        last quarter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going through the work of getting this printed, it occured to me that
        most people aren't going to be able to easily get this built, or might
        be charged a lot by 3d print studios local to them, so I decided to list
        the item on ebay as an experiment. This actually garnered a lot of
        interest and produced two sales, which is surprising because I
        intentionally priced the item higher so as to not get inundated with
        orders.
      </p>

      <p>
        Had there been more interest I might have been inclined to have my 3d
        printed model cast into a mould so that a local metal worker could have
        easily made them en masse.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've since removed the listing, but if you're one of the 0 people in the
        world who have ended up here and also need this mount, then send me
        message and I'll be glad to have one printed for you.
