      <h2>Adventures in Philanthropic Investing - Lombok</h2>
      <p>
        Firstly, if you haven't been to Bali, stop reading and go! Secondly, if
        you love Bali, but want someting a bit farther off the beaten path, head
        over to Lombok (one island over), it's like Bali but circa 2000 AD.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, I came across this project because my sister has business in
        Indonesia. From here on I'm just going to keep writing as things come to
        me, so the information will likely get a bit convoluted as it's quite
        the random side project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general gist of it is that after
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_August_2018_Lombok_earthquake"
          >the earthquake</a
        >
        they're still far from fully rebuilt in some places even a full year
        later. I chalk it up to part villager naievety, part local indonesian
        investor greed, and a heaping of much-to-be-desired-beaurocracy
        sprinkled throughout. The image of the unfinished house below has been
        sitting as is for months when a single house shouldn't take a small team
        more than a couple weeks.
      </p>

      <h2>But... why???</h2>
      <p>
        So the Indonesian government is funding the rebuild according to certain
        guidelines; of note, is that they pay out construction in phases, so X
        $s when you finish X % or X item. Certain investors who shall not be
        named, mostly because I don't know anything about them other than
        they're local to the country, likely Jakarta, but not local to Bali,
        will as an example, spend the bare minimum to build say, the roof, then
        collect the government payout and bail, likely because building the
        project in its entirety isn't as profitable. Why the government doesn't
        just do the construction themselves is beyond me,
      </p>

      <h2>So what's so different about you?</h2>

      <p>
        Well, simply put, any potential profit doesn't really matter to me, as
        the only reason I'm even considering this is because I just want the
        houses built so these people have a roof over their heads, maybe also a
        school or two, and other things like working street lights. And as long
        as we're breaking even we can continue to fund more projects. I have run
        the numbers from my partner on the ground, Andreas, however, and it does
        seem that we'll have a positive margin of about 20% per project, each of
        which takes 1-3 months depending on team size and weather. This is great
        news as it'll beef up our funds, and allow us to take on larger
        projects, with the only downside that I can think of being, "what if the
        government doesn't pay out for whatever reason?" This is still indonesia
        after all...
      </p>

      <h2>Stay tuned...</h2>

      <p>
        As of today, a local entity has been incorporated, a bank account
        created, and a wire is on it's way. Though the funds I've sent are
        non-trivial (at least to me), I do have enough confidence this will all
        work out in the end, and that the financial risk is worth it because the
        altenative would be these people will continue to sleep without roofs
        over their heads, or schools, or basic utilities.
